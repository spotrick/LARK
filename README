NAME
    LARK

DESCRIPTION
    LARK is a Lighweight Archive System for building an archive.

    A Lark archive is defined as a configuration file and an arbitrarily
    nested set of objects, using the file system as storage.

    An object may be a collection of other objects, or it may be a document.

    A collection includes metadata describing the object, and optionally one
    or more objects.

        <object id="example"
            description="This is an example collection object"
            title="An example of a collection"
            type="collection">
          <contents id="1" title="Object 1" />
          <contents id="1" title="Object 2" />
        </object>

    This example would be stored as .../example/object.xml

    A document includes metadata describing the document, and optionally one
    or more data files respresenting the document, in any desired digital
    format (jpg, pdf, mp3, doc, xls, ...).

        <object id="1"
            description="This is an example document object"
            title="An example of a document"
            type="image">
          <contents id="some.jpg" title="example photograph" />
        </object>

    This example would be stored as .../example/1/object.xml and
    .../example/1/some.jpg

CONFIGURATION
    An archive requires a configuration file, config.xml, in the root
    directory of the archive.

    A minimal configuration would be:

        <config>
          <root>/data/example</root>
        </config>

    i.e. we have to at least tell LARK where the files are!

    A more detailed example, allowing for the archive to be exposed on the
    Web, would be:

        <config>
          <root>/data/example</root>
          <home>http://www.myschool.edu/lark/example</home>
          <title>Lark example</title>
          <!-- document types -->
          <types>
            <type id="collection">
              <field id="000" name="id" type="text" size="20" caption="ID" />
              <field id="001" name="title" type="text" size="50" caption="Title" />
              <field id="007" name="description" type="textarea" cols="50" rows="5" caption="Description" />
              ...
            </type>
            <type id="document">
              <field id="000" name="id" type="text" size="20" caption="ID" />
              <field id="001" name="title" type="text" size="50" caption="Title" />
              <field id="002" name="author" type="text" size="50" caption="Author" />
              ...
            </type>
            <type id="photograph">
              <field id="000" name="id" type="text" size="20" caption="ID" />
              <field id="001" name="title" type="text" size="50" caption="Title" />
              <field id="002" name="photographer" type="text" size="50" caption="Photographer" />
              ...
            </type>
            ...
          </types>
          <!-- html code for building web pages -->
          <html id="htmlhead"><![CDATA[
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Language" content="en" />
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
    <link rel="StyleSheet" type="text/css" href="/coll/lark.css" />
          ]]></html>
        </config>

    In this example, we've defined some object types (collection, document,
    photograph, ...) and some html code to be included when we build web
    pages. Our CGI script, lark.cgi, uses these when constructing a web edit
    form, and for building web pages.

    You can also include any other configuration values which might be used
    in locally written script.
